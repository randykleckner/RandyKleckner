## 🚀 About Me

I'm a customer-focused problem solver with 11+ years at Apple, now transitioning into Customer Success and AI-driven roles. I blend leadership, empathy, and technical know-how to drive great customer experiences — and I’m leveling up with tools like Python, SQL, GitHub, and AI platforms.

I'm also working toward a Bachelor's degree and building a portfolio of hands-on projects to showcase my transition into data and AI work.
